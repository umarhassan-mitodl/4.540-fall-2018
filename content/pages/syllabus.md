Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

There are no formal prerequisites for this course, though it is assumed that students taking it will have a background in design.

Course Description
------------------

Shape grammars are systems of visual rules by which one shape may be transformed into another. By applying these rules recursively, a simple shape can be elaborated into a complex pattern. This course offers an in-depth introduction to shape grammars and their applications in architecture and related areas of design. More specifically, it involves manipulation of shapes in the algebras U{{< sub "ij" >}}, in the algebras V{{< sub "ij" >}} and W{{< sub "ij" >}} incorporating labels and weights, and in algebras formed as composites of these. Discussions center on rules and computations, shape and structure, and designs.

Grading
-------

Grades for this seminar-style class are based on the instructor's holistic assessment of students' engagement with the material. There are no specific required assignments or exams.

1\. Overview


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Shapes and symbols

*   Rules for shapes – this shape → that shape
*   Rules for symbols – description of this shape → description of that shape

The embed-fuse cycle

*   Embedding vs identity
*   Shapes fuse, symbols don’t

Shape grammars in art and design

*   Dimension i ≠ 0 vs dimension i = 0
*   Imagination : fancy :: shapes : symbols
